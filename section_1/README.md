## How will you use the Twitter API or Twitter data?  
SAI-Lab lnc.will use the Twitter API for AI-related educational activites.  
It is mainly used in our lectures.  
We use data from Twitter to perform machine learning and natural language processing to analyze trends in Tweets.  
The lecture is Yukinaga Azuma.  
## Are you planning to analyze Twitter data?  
Collects tweet data and uses recursive neural networks and other tools to analyze what words users say next.  
This allows the system to automatically generate sentences.  
## Will your app use Tweet,Retweet,like,follow,or Direct Message functionality?  
Post the text generated by the recursive neural network to the timeline.  
This allows us to see how well the AI can generate appropriate sentences for Twitter.    
## Do you plan to display Tweets or aggregate data about Twitter content outside of Twitter?  
We will show students the tweets Iget in the lecture.  
We will work together to see what the data for training looks like.
